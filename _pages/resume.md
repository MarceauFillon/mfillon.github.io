# About me

>### Graduate student in Robotics and embedded systems

I am a 23 years old master’s student in Robotics at CPE Lyon.
My studies and personal projects, the hackathons I took part off and the internships I did, helped me develop my adaptability as well as many technical skills at various levels. From object-oriented programming to the development of web-based user interfaces, complementing my knowledge of lower level programming (bash, embedded C, etc.), I now have a very solid technical background.

During my gap year, I had the chance to participate in the development of the PLEN Cube robot during a six-month internship in Japan. Subsequently, a significant experience as an intern right-hand man of the CTO in a New York startup company allowed me to acquire a very good level of English as well as a fluency in writing technical documentation. Naturally endowed with good relational skills, I particularly appreciate teamwork.
