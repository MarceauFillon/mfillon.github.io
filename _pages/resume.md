# About me
---

I am a 23 years old engineer, graduated from the french engineering school CPE LYON.

With a strong background in robotics and software engineering, from CPE LYON and
UPC Barcelona, I managed to build myself a set of skills in various languages such as Python,
Java, C and C#, with various robotic and software applications. 

I recently worked in two high technology companies in USA and
Hong Kong. Those two experiences enhanced my programming and project skills, but also
opened my mind to various cultural and professional environments.

I am now seeking for new challenges in Melbourne, starting October 2019, where I hope to find a junior software engineer position in a project for a great cause,
such as Healthcare or sustainable development, in an innovative company or a research department.
